# Feedforward and NARX neural network library using visual studio 2017 and [eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

* Multithreading support with and without openmp

* [Example](https://github.com/mrnul/Neural-nets/blob/master/examples/example_mnist.cpp) works with [MNIST handwritten digit database converted to csv](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/).
Best result was 98.97% accuracy after 73 epochs

*  A NARXNN was trained using 3 images of landscapes found on google (converted to 100 x 100 bmp format 256 colors) and this was the result<br/>
