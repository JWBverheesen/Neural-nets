# Feedforward and NARX neural network library using visual studio 2017 and eigen library with openmp

Example works with MNIST handwritten digit database converted to csv (https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/)
best result was 98.77% accuracy after 66 epochs (topology: 784 - 250 - 250 - 10 )

A NARXNN was trained using 3 images of landscapes found on google (converted to 100 x 100 bmp format 256 colors) and this was the result
